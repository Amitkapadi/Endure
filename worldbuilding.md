# Worldbuilding

## Potential setting: post-apocalyptic

What caused the apocalypse?
 * Virus caused by a cult?
     - they might have bioengineered it
     - mostly only humans died
     - Netherlands, San Francisco, etc would be gone from loss of levies and such
     - Power plants blown up
     - (people would have forgotten )
 * World is vastly underpopulated
 * 1 in 1000 survived
 * Government is gone
 * Everybody starts to form clans
 * Faint memory of pre-apocalypse

(Perhaps EMP from sun storm)

Nanobots?

Call current technology "magic"

In post-apocalyptic United States
Apocalypse happened in 2021
Game happens in 2221

## Character
One person, with no known background (perhaps randomized sprite)
Or maybe one of group of five friends (try this once we already have most of the game working)
 * Possibly switch periodically
 * Perhaps if your health has drained
 * Switch whenever you die
 * Switch based on time of day
 * Might interact with others as NPCs
 * Let person choose one of the five characters

Why is he walking around? Why does he want to go places?
 * Adventurer who has heard legends of a better place?
 * You were in a caravan, which was attacked
 * You wake up, everyone is dead, you can't remember last several days or where you're going
     - You have a map!
     - It shows where you are, and there's another place marked (the place you're trying to get to)

## Enemies

 * Other humans
 * Raiders, highwaymen
 * Roving bands
 * You accidentally say the wrong thing to someone and now all his friends want to kill you
 * Factions
 * Cults (goofy guys in robes)
 * Some clans are starting to build larger militaries and such

Ron the hedgehog?

## Currency
 * Mostly bartering-based economy


## Length
Try for hour long game?

## Obstacles

 * Fighting with enemies
 * River
 * Rock wall

## Combat
 * Knife
 * Sword
 * Bows and arrows
 * Crossbows
 * Guns - very rare
 * you'd have to find ammo as well

 * Shield

 * Move with keys
 * Range combat use mouse
 * hold key for shield

Time period: 30-40 years? no, 200 years

Very low maybe: fantasy
 * "fantasy" in the sense that current technology is considered magic by the time period in the game
